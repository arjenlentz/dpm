PRACTICE:

set libevent to listen on socket with callback, accept sockets.
signal ignore sigpipe
signal handle sigint?
handle reading data on socket, printing locally.
handle writing data back to socket
try basic ragel implementation to handle reading/writing commands
embed lua; pass input commands to lua, allow callback to set config vars
see about implementing mysql protocol (as a server)
see about working mysql protocol (as a client)
(how much can be done in lua? perhaps?)
more libevent infrastructure; timers, buffering
memory management; caching connection shit. malloc big range. reuse buffers.
