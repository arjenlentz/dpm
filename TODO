PRACTICE:

DONE ### set libevent to listen on socket with callback, accept sockets.
signal ignore sigpipe
signal handle sigint?
DONE ### handle reading data on socket, printing locally.
handle writing data back to socket
try basic ragel implementation to handle reading/writing commands
embed lua; pass input commands to lua, allow callback to set config vars
proper read/write buffering for event sockets.
see about implementing mysql protocol (as a server)
see about working mysql protocol (as a client)
(how much can be done in lua? perhaps?)
more libevent infrastructure; timers, buffering
memory management; caching connection shit. malloc big range. reuse buffers.
use multiple .c files to make the program.
write a makefile
