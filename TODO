Blockers for release-5:

- microtime resolution checks
- timer based callbacks
- dpml function: client accept (auth, no auth)
- dpml function: passthrough accept
- dpml function: read resultset (+ get server flags, etc)
- flush all connections which were written to during callback

Blockers for release-6:

- pick one code style to clean up, and clean it
- support at least COM_CHANGE_USER, COM_PING
- parsing code for COM_STATISTICS
- Find out how to insert 'array' elements into a table. pushinteger appears to
  be using nrec elements in a table (see luaobj.c:_rset_parse_data)
- start test package (perl TAP? Probably)
- coroutine demo

can probably force "max buffer size" of MAX_PACKET_SIZE. write some logic for
look up TCP options.. SO_KEEPALIVE, SO_LINGER, etc
memory management; caching connection structs. malloc big range. reuse buffers.
not all of the state machine names make sense; clean it up.
use dynamic network buffers instead of connection-static buffers. figure best
scatter/gather technique

DONE ## create working accessors for int, uint64_t, uint32_t, enum flag, bit flag
WORK ## create working accessors for uint16_t, uint8_t, null terminated strings
WORK ## create working accessor for length encoded strings
